BVT Clean Up Tool

Goal:
The goal of this tool is to delete artifacts created by the GUI and API
BVT test harnesses on both on premise and smart cloud installations. This 
tool supports the clean up of any server assuming a property file for the users 
exists.  Both UI .csv and API .properties file types are supported. 

The tool removes existing artifacts in the following applications:
- Communities
- Activites
- Files (files and folders)
- Profiles Contacts
- Bookmarks
- Blog (on prem only)
- Wikis (on prem only)
- Forums (on prem only)

To run against On Prem:
java -jar bvt.cleanup.jar -s <server url> -u <user file path> [Options]

To run against Smart Cloud:
java -jar bvt.cleanup.jar -s <server url> -u <user file path> -c [Options]

Other Arguments:
Other arguments can be found by passing the -h or --help or -? argument to the
tool. For convenience I've included the table of arguments below:
    -c, --cloud         Running against a cloud server
    -p, --onprem        Running against an onprem server (default)
    -s, --serverurl     Define the server url to run against [REQUIRED]
    -u, --users         Define the user properties file path [REQUIRED]
    -P, --pagesize      Define the size of pages to request from the server.
                        The default is 250. This must be at least as large as
                        the keep amount. [OPTIONAL]
    -k, --keepamount    Define the number of items to keep from each component.
                        The default is 50 [OPTIONAL]
    -h,-?, --help       Display this help message

Performance Tweaking:
Because the default page size request is 250 and the tool runs runs users in a
thread pool of # of Cores or # of Users, which ever is smaller the tool uses a
large amount of cpu and memory. It is recommended to increasing the maximum
memory available to the jvm. 2GB should be enough memory for up to 32 threads.
You can also reduce memory foot print by decreasing page size using the -P
option. However note that, page size must be at least as large as the number of
items to keep which is set by the -k option.
